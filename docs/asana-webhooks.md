# Asana Webhooks

The Asana webhook receiver is implemented in `src/lib/asana-webhook.ts` and exposed through Hono at:

```text
POST /api/webhooks/asana
```

## Webhook URL

Create project-level Asana webhooks with a workspace lookup key and project lookup key on the target URL:

```text
https://<app-origin>/api/webhooks/asana?asanaWorkspaceGid=<asana-workspace-gid>&asanaProjectGid=<asana-project-gid>
```

`workspaceId=<vertex-workspace-id>` is also accepted for the workspace key. `webhookKey=<stable-key>` is accepted as a generic resource key. Use a unique resource key for each webhook because Asana gives each webhook its own signing secret.

## Automatic Setup

When a user maps or scaffolds an Asana project in Profile > Asana, the app saves the `asana_project_mappings` row and then runs an idempotent webhook ensure step.

The ensure step:

1. Checks `asana_project_webhooks` for an active webhook matching the expected target URL.
2. Checks Asana's webhook list for an existing active project webhook when the token can read webhooks.
3. Creates a project-level webhook only when no matching active webhook exists.
4. Stores the returned webhook gid, target URL, status, and last error in `asana_project_webhooks`.

Mapping saves are not rolled back if webhook setup fails. Instead, the failure is recorded in `asana_project_webhooks`, and the Repair webhooks action in Profile > Asana can rerun setup for all mapped projects.

Profile > Asana also shows a Webhook status panel for mapped projects. Use it to confirm whether each mapped project has an active webhook, inspect the recorded Asana webhook gid and target URL, and read the most recent setup error if creation or repair failed.

## Handshake

When Asana creates a webhook, it sends `X-Hook-Secret`. The Worker:

1. Reads the exact header value.
2. Stores it in the `ASANA_WEBHOOK_SECRETS` KV namespace under the workspace plus resource lookup key.
3. Returns `200 OK` with the exact same `X-Hook-Secret` response header.

No request body parsing is needed for the handshake.

## Event Verification

For standard event deliveries, the Worker verifies the request before parsing JSON:

1. Reads the raw request body with `request.arrayBuffer()`.
2. Reads `X-Hook-Signature`, with `X-Asana-Request-Signature` accepted for compatibility.
3. Retrieves the workspace secret from `ASANA_WEBHOOK_SECRETS`.
4. Imports the secret with Web Crypto HMAC SHA-256 verify permissions.
5. Calls `crypto.subtle.verify` against the raw request body.

Node.js crypto APIs are not used. Missing or invalid signatures return `401 Unauthorized`.

## Persistence

After signature verification succeeds, task events are parsed and upserted through Drizzle into `asana_webhook_task_states`.

Webhook setup state is stored in `asana_project_webhooks`. Verified event payload state is stored in `asana_webhook_task_states`.

The receiver then resolves project-chat delivery through `asana_project_mappings`, followed by the optional `ASANA_WEBHOOK_PROJECT_MAP` fallback. Matching updates are inserted as system chat messages, published through `CHAT_SYNC`, and recorded in the D1 `events` table for SSE invalidation.

This is not a two-way task sync. VertexAI-created workflow tasks can be pushed to Asana manually, or automatically when the user's Profile > Asana setting is enabled. Asana webhook events do not create, update, complete, or delete VertexAI task records.

## Bindings

- `ASANA_WEBHOOK_SECRETS`: KV namespace for per-workspace Asana webhook secrets.
- `ASANA_WEBHOOK_ORIGIN`: public Worker origin used for generated target URLs.
- `DB`: D1 database used for task state, mappings, chat messages, and mutation events.
- `CHAT_SYNC`: Durable Object namespace for live chat append delivery.
- `ASANA_WEBHOOK_SOURCE_USER_ID`: optional local user id used as the source for mutation events.
- `ASANA_WEBHOOK_PROJECT_MAP`: optional JSON mapping from Asana project or task gids to local project/chat targets.
- `ASANA_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: optional legacy fallback only; prefer the KV-backed handshake path.
