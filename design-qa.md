viewport: 1200x750 desktop preview, plus 390x844 mobile validation
state: Chat tab, Team Project mode, Vertex Hub shared chat, PMO Improvement Queue detail panel
full-view comparison evidence: C:\Users\RCormier\OneDrive - Vertex Education\Documents\AI Website\qa\comparison-desktop.png
focused region comparison evidence: Focused checks covered the top navigation, left rail, chat thread, workspace detail panel, mobile header, add-idea modal, and composer placement. Separate focused image crops were not needed because the 1200x750 comparison and mobile screenshot made the relevant UI surfaces readable.

**Findings**
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 issues remain.
- The implementation intentionally replaces the source's final-artifact workspace with a PMO improvement queue because the requested prototype centers on improvement ideas, status filters, add-idea flow, and detail review.
- The desktop source includes a mobile mockup beside the desktop mockup. The implementation instead provides responsive behavior at the actual mobile breakpoint, validated separately.

**Required Fidelity Surfaces**
- Fonts and typography: Uses Geist/Arial-style sans typography with similar enterprise density, small metadata labels, compact tabs, and readable chat copy. No clipping observed in desktop or mobile checks.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: Desktop shell matches the source structure with primary rail, topbar, breadcrumb/tabs, project navigation, central chat, and right workspace. Composer is visible in the first desktop viewport after the frame-height fix.
- Colors and visual tokens: Uses the source's navy rail and white panel system with restrained blue, green, amber, teal, coral, and purple status tones.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: Avatar images are real raster images, and functional icons come from an icon library. No placeholder image boxes remain.
- Copy and content: Chat, artifacts, PMO idea titles, status labels, metrics, evidence, and next steps are realistic and product-specific.

**Interaction Checks**
- Add-idea modal opens from Ideas, accepts title/category/status/impact/summary, and adds the new idea to the queue.
- Status filters reduce the idea list.
- Idea selection updates the detail panel.
- Detail status select updates the idea status.
- Share opens the sharing popover.
- Composer sends a user message and renders an assistant response in the Chat tab.
- Mobile 390x844 validation has no horizontal overflow and hides desktop rail/project navigation.
- Primary rail switches workspace tabs.
- Project and chat navigation update breadcrumb/context state.
- Decision rows toggle status between open and done.
- Manage access opens an access modal and persists the chosen view/edit mode in the access block.
- Notifications, model, workspace, and attachment popovers open and close from visible controls.
- Artifact rows select an artifact, and Create artifact generates a new draft artifact from the current idea.
- Official Vertex logo assets from `brand.vertexeducation.com` render in the rail and header.
- Project switching now loads project-specific chat lists and demo conversations for Vertex Hub, LMS Next Gen, Data Migration, and AI Innovation Lab.
- Attachment, workspace/web, and model popovers are anchored to the composer and no longer render at the top of the page.

**Patches Made Since Previous QA Pass**
- Added stable test IDs and explicit labels for modal, detail, and composer controls.
- Constrained desktop app frame height so chat panels scroll internally and the composer stays visible.
- Added `min-height: 0` and hidden overflow to the workspace shell so grid children respect viewport height.
- Styled nested panel scrollbars to reduce visual noise.
- Added full stateful interactions for rail navigation, project/chat selection, access management, topbar popovers, artifact selection/generation, and decision status toggles.
- Added official Vertex brand SVG assets from `brand.vertexeducation.com`.
- Added project-specific chat maps and realistic conversation content.
- Split composer controls into composer-local popovers so attachment, workspace, and model menus open at the input area.

**Validation Notes**
- `npm run lint` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.
- Browser click validation passed for rail navigation, project switching, decision toggling, access mode saving, notification popover, artifact generation, desktop overflow, and mobile overflow.
- Browser validation passed for brand logo rendering, LMS/Data Migration project chat switching, project-specific messages, and composer popover anchoring.
- Browser text entry validation was partially blocked by the Browser plugin's virtual clipboard path, but the text-entry handlers compile, the fields are rendered, and the add-idea/chat submit logic was validated in the previous pass before this broader interaction expansion.

**Follow-up Polish**
- A future iteration could add a mobile bottom navigation and richer artifact share states, but these are not blockers for the requested clickable prototype.

final result: passed
