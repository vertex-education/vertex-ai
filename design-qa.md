implementation screenshot path: C:\Users\RCormier\OneDrive - Vertex Education\Documents\AI Website\public\screenshot.jpeg
viewport: 1200x750 desktop preview, plus 390x844 mobile validation
state: Chat tab, Team Project mode, Vertex Hub shared chat, PMO Improvement Queue detail panel
full-view comparison evidence: C:\Users\RCormier\OneDrive - Vertex Education\Documents\AI Website\qa\comparison-desktop.png
focused region comparison evidence: Focused checks covered the top navigation, left rail, chat thread, workspace detail panel, mobile header, add-idea modal, and composer placement. Separate focused image crops were not needed because the 1200x750 comparison and mobile screenshot made the relevant UI surfaces readable.

**Findings**
- No actionable P0/P1/P2 issues remain.
- The implementation intentionally replaces the source's final-artifact workspace with a PMO improvement queue because the requested prototype centers on improvement ideas, status filters, add-idea flow, and detail review.
- The desktop source includes a mobile mockup beside the desktop mockup. The implementation instead provides responsive behavior at the actual mobile breakpoint, validated separately.

**Required Fidelity Surfaces**
- Fonts and typography: Uses Geist/Arial-style sans typography with similar enterprise density, small metadata labels, compact tabs, and readable chat copy. No clipping observed in desktop or mobile checks.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: Desktop shell matches the source structure with primary rail, topbar, breadcrumb/tabs, project navigation, central chat, and right workspace. Composer is visible in the first desktop viewport after the frame-height fix.
- Colors and visual tokens: Uses the source's navy rail and white panel system with restrained blue, green, amber, teal, coral, and purple status tones.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: Avatar images are real raster images, and functional icons come from an icon library. No placeholder image boxes remain.
- Copy and content: Chat, artifacts, PMO idea titles, status labels, metrics, evidence, and next steps are realistic and product-specific.

**Interaction Checks**
- Add-idea modal opens from Ideas, accepts title/category/status/impact/summary, and adds the new idea to the queue.
- Status filters reduce the idea list.
- Idea selection updates the detail panel.
- Detail status select updates the idea status.
- Share opens the sharing popover.
- Composer sends a user message and renders an assistant response in the Chat tab.
- Mobile 390x844 validation has no horizontal overflow and hides desktop rail/project navigation.

**Patches Made Since Previous QA Pass**
- Added stable test IDs and explicit labels for modal, detail, and composer controls.
- Constrained desktop app frame height so chat panels scroll internally and the composer stays visible.
- Added `min-height: 0` and hidden overflow to the workspace shell so grid children respect viewport height.
- Styled nested panel scrollbars to reduce visual noise.

**Follow-up Polish**
- A future iteration could add a mobile bottom navigation and richer artifact share states, but these are not blockers for the requested clickable prototype.

final result: passed
